# hamiltorch


 PyTorch-based library for Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) and inference in Bayesian neural networks

 * Perform HMC in user-defined log probabilities and in PyTorch neural networks (objects inheriting from the `torch.nn.Module`).
 * Available sampling schemes:
     * HMC
     * No-U-Turn Sampler (currently adapts step-size only)
     * Implicit RMHMC
     * Explicit RMHMC
     * Symmetric Split HMC

 ## How to install

```
pip install git+https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch
```

 ## How does it work?

 There are currently two blog posts that describe how to use `hamiltorch`:

 * For basic usage and an introduction please refer to my earlier post in 2019 ["hamiltorch: a PyTorch Python package for sampling"](https://adamcobb.github.io/journal/hamiltorch.html)
 * For a more recent summary and a focus on Bayesian neural networks, please see my post ["Scaling HMC to larger data sets"](https://adamcobb.github.io/journal/bnn.html)

 There are also notebook-style tutorials:

 * [Sampling from generic log probabilities](https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch/blob/master/notebooks/hamiltorch_log_prob_examples.ipynb)
 * [Sampling from `torch.nn.Module` (basic)](https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch/blob/master/notebooks/hamiltorch_Bayesian_NN_example.ipynb)
 * [Bayesian neural networks and split HMC](https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch/blob/master/notebooks/hamiltorch_split_HMC_BNN_example.ipynb)
